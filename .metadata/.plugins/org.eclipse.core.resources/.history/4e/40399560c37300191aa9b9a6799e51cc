//Imagine you had to write an email client for sending emails with different characteristics and you came up with a basic public contract like the one below: 
//
//public interface EmailService {
//
//    void send(Email email);
//
//}
//
//The emails can be sent as plain text or as HTML and emails, which are sent outside the company servers need to be logged and have a disclaimer added to the end.
//What is worse, the emails could also be encrypted with AES or DES, or even both at the same time.  
//Your boss tells you that in case there are problems when sending the emails you should retry the sending operation up to three times.
//
//Design a simple client with the accompanying class(es) which you consider to be necessary and write a short program inside the standard void main(String[] args) function that would implement
//the following scenarios by making use of your class(es):
//
//-          sending a plain text email to an outside resource, with a disclaimer added at the end, unencrypted and no retry
//
//-          sending an HTML email to an internal server (so without the disclaimer), encrypted with DES, with the retry functionality
//
//-          sending an HTML email to an outside resource, with a disclaimer added at the end and encrypted with AES with retries in case of errors
//
//-          sending a plain text email to an outside resource and encrypted first with DES and then with AES
